      <P><FONT face=Verdana><U>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC 
      LICENSE</U><BR>Version 2, June 1991</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, 
      Inc.<BR>59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA&nbsp; 02111-1307&nbsp; 
      USA<BR>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<BR>of 
      this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>Preamble</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>The licenses for most software are designed to take 
      away your<BR>freedom to share and change it.&nbsp; By contrast, the GNU 
      General Public<BR>License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share 
      and change free<BR>software--to make sure the software is free for all its 
      users.&nbsp; This<BR>General Public License applies to most of the Free 
      Software<BR>Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors 
      commit to<BR>using it.&nbsp; (Some other Free Software Foundation software 
      is covered by<BR>the GNU Library General Public License instead.)&nbsp; 
      You can apply it to<BR>your programs, too.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>When we speak of free software, we are referring to 
      freedom, not<BR>price.&nbsp; Our General Public Licenses are designed to 
      make sure that you<BR>have the freedom to distribute copies of free 
      software (and charge for<BR>this service if you wish), that you receive 
      source code or can get it<BR>if you want it, that you can change the 
      software or use pieces of it<BR>in new free programs; and that you know 
      you can do these things.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions 
      that forbid<BR>anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender 
      the rights.<BR>These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities 
      for you if you<BR>distribute copies of the software, or if you modify 
      it.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>For example, if you distribute copies of such a 
      program, whether<BR>gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all 
      the rights that<BR>you have.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too, 
      receive or can get the<BR>source code.&nbsp; And you must show them these 
      terms so they know their<BR>rights.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright 
      the software, and<BR>(2) offer you this license which gives you legal 
      permission to copy,<BR>distribute and/or modify the software.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want 
      to make certain<BR>that everyone understands that there is no warranty for 
      this free<BR>software.&nbsp; If the software is modified by someone else 
      and passed on, we<BR>want its recipients to know that what they have is 
      not the original, so<BR>that any problems introduced by others will not 
      reflect on the original<BR>authors' reputations.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly 
      by software<BR>patents.&nbsp; We wish to avoid the danger that 
      redistributors of a free<BR>program will individually obtain patent 
      licenses, in effect making the<BR>program proprietary.&nbsp; To prevent 
      this, we have made it clear that any<BR>patent must be licensed for 
      everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>The precise terms and conditions for copying, 
      distribution and<BR>modification follow.<BR><BR>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC 
      LICENSE<BR>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND 
      MODIFICATION</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>0. This License applies to any program or other work 
      which contains<BR>a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be 
      distributed<BR>under the terms of this General Public License.&nbsp; The 
      "Program", below,<BR>refers to any such program or work, and a "work based 
      on the Program"<BR>means either the Program or any derivative work under 
      copyright law:<BR>that is to say, a work containing the Program or a 
      portion of it,<BR>either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated 
      into another<BR>language.&nbsp; (Hereinafter, translation is included 
      without limitation in<BR>the term "modification".)&nbsp; Each licensee is 
      addressed as "you".</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>Activities other than copying, distribution and 
      modification are not<BR>covered by this License; they are outside its 
      scope.&nbsp; The act of<BR>running the Program is not restricted, and the 
      output from the Program<BR>is covered only if its contents constitute a 
      work based on the<BR>Program (independent of having been made by running 
      the Program).<BR>Whether that is true depends on what the Program 
      does.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of 
      the Program's<BR>source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided 
      that you<BR>conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an 
      appropriate<BR>copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact 
      all the<BR>notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any 
      warranty;<BR>and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this 
      License<BR>along with the Program.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>You may charge a fee for the physical act of 
      transferring a copy, and<BR>you may at your option offer warranty 
      protection in exchange for a fee.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program 
      or any portion<BR>of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and 
      copy and<BR>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of 
      Section 1<BR>above, provided that you also meet all of these 
      conditions:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) You must cause the modified 
      files to carry prominent notices<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stating that you 
      changed the files and the date of any change.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) You must cause any work that 
      you distribute or publish, that in<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whole or in part 
      contains or is derived from the Program or any<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; part 
      thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all 
      third<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parties under the terms of this 
      License.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) If the modified program 
      normally reads commands interactively<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when run, you 
      must cause it, when started running for such<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display 
      an<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; announcement including an appropriate copyright 
      notice and a<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notice that there is no warranty (or 
      else, saying that you provide<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a warranty) and that 
      users may redistribute the program under<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these 
      conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of 
      this<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License.&nbsp; (Exception: if the Program 
      itself is interactive but<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does not normally print 
      such an announcement, your work based on<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Program 
      is not required to print an announcement.)<BR><BR>These requirements 
      apply to the modified work as a whole.&nbsp; If<BR>identifiable sections 
      of that work are not derived from the Program,<BR>and can be reasonably 
      considered independent and separate works in<BR>themselves, then this 
      License, and its terms, do not apply to those<BR>sections when you 
      distribute them as separate works.&nbsp; But when you<BR>distribute the 
      same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<BR>on the Program, 
      the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<BR>this License, 
      whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<BR>entire whole, and 
      thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim 
      rights or contest<BR>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, 
      the intent is to<BR>exercise the right to control the distribution of 
      derivative or<BR>collective works based on the Program.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not 
      based on the Program<BR>with the Program (or with a work based on the 
      Program) on a volume of<BR>a storage or distribution medium does not bring 
      the other work under<BR>the scope of this License.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a 
      work based on it,<BR>under Section 2) in object code or executable form 
      under the terms of<BR>Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one 
      of the following:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany it with the complete 
      corresponding machine-readable<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source code, which 
      must be distributed under the terms of Sections<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 
      and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; 
      or,</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany it with a written 
      offer, valid for at least three<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; years, to give any 
      third party, for a charge no more than your<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cost of 
      physically performing source distribution, a 
      complete<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine-readable copy of the corresponding 
      source code, to be<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distributed under the terms of 
      Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily used 
      for software interchange; or,</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Accompany it with the 
      information you received as to the offer<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to 
      distribute corresponding source code.&nbsp; (This alternative 
      is<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allowed only for noncommercial distribution and 
      only if you<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; received the program in object code or 
      executable form with such<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an offer, in accord with 
      Subsection b above.)</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>The source code for a work means the preferred form 
      of the work for<BR>making modifications to it.&nbsp; For an executable 
      work, complete source<BR>code means all the source code for all modules it 
      contains, plus any<BR>associated interface definition files, plus the 
      scripts used to<BR>control compilation and installation of the 
      executable.&nbsp; However, as a<BR>special exception, the source code 
      distributed need not include<BR>anything that is normally distributed (in 
      either source or binary<BR>form) with the major components (compiler, 
      kernel, and so on) of the<BR>operating system on which the executable 
      runs, unless that component<BR>itself accompanies the 
      executable.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>If distribution of executable or object code is made 
      by offering<BR>access to copy from a designated place, then offering 
      equivalent<BR>access to copy the source code from the same place counts 
      as<BR>distribution of the source code, even though third parties are 
      not<BR>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<BR><BR>4. 
      You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<BR>except 
      as expressly provided under this License.&nbsp; Any attempt<BR>otherwise 
      to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<BR>void, and will 
      automatically terminate your rights under this License.<BR>However, 
      parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<BR>this 
      License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<BR>parties 
      remain in full compliance.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>5. You are not required to accept this License, 
      since you have not<BR>signed it.&nbsp; However, nothing else grants you 
      permission to modify or<BR>distribute the Program or its derivative 
      works.&nbsp; These actions are<BR>prohibited by law if you do not accept 
      this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by<BR>modifying or distributing the Program 
      (or any work based on the<BR>Program), you indicate your acceptance of 
      this License to do so, and<BR>all its terms and conditions for copying, 
      distributing or modifying<BR>the Program or works based on it.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any 
      work based on the<BR>Program), the recipient automatically receives a 
      license from the<BR>original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the 
      Program subject to<BR>these terms and conditions.&nbsp; You may not impose 
      any further<BR>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights 
      granted herein.<BR>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by 
      third parties to<BR>this License.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or 
      allegation of patent<BR>infringement or for any other reason (not limited 
      to patent issues),<BR>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court 
      order, agreement or<BR>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this 
      License, they do not<BR>excuse you from the conditions of this 
      License.&nbsp; If you cannot<BR>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously 
      your obligations under this<BR>License and any other pertinent 
      obligations, then as a consequence you<BR>may not distribute the Program 
      at all.&nbsp; For example, if a patent<BR>license would not permit 
      royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<BR>all those who receive 
      copies directly or indirectly through you, then<BR>the only way you could 
      satisfy both it and this License would be to<BR>refrain entirely from 
      distribution of the Program.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>If any portion of this section is held invalid or 
      unenforceable under<BR>any particular circumstance, the balance of the 
      section is intended to<BR>apply and the section as a whole is intended to 
      apply in other<BR>circumstances.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you 
      to infringe any<BR>patents or other property right claims or to contest 
      validity of any<BR>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of 
      protecting the<BR>integrity of the free software distribution system, 
      which is<BR>implemented by public license practices.&nbsp; Many people 
      have made<BR>generous contributions to the wide range of software 
      distributed<BR>through that system in reliance on consistent application 
      of that<BR>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is 
      willing<BR>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee 
      cannot<BR>impose that choice.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear 
      what is believed to<BR>be a consequence of the rest of this 
      License.<BR><BR>8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is 
      restricted in<BR>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
      interfaces, the<BR>original copyright holder who places the Program under 
      this License<BR>may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation 
      excluding<BR>those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or 
      among<BR>countries not thus excluded.&nbsp; In such case, this License 
      incorporates<BR>the limitation as if written in the body of this 
      License.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised 
      and/or new versions<BR>of the General Public License from time to 
      time.&nbsp; Such new versions will<BR>be similar in spirit to the present 
      version, but may differ in detail to<BR>address new problems or 
      concerns.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>Each version is given a distinguishing version 
      number.&nbsp; If the Program<BR>specifies a version number of this License 
      which applies to it and "any<BR>later version", you have the option of 
      following the terms and conditions<BR>either of that version or of any 
      later version published by the Free<BR>Software Foundation.&nbsp; If the 
      Program does not specify a version number of<BR>this License, you may 
      choose any version ever published by the Free 
      Software<BR>Foundation.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program 
      into other free<BR>programs whose distribution conditions are different, 
      write to the author<BR>to ask for permission.&nbsp; For software which is 
      copyrighted by the Free<BR>Software Foundation, write to the Free Software 
      Foundation; we sometimes<BR>make exceptions for this.&nbsp; Our decision 
      will be guided by the two goals<BR>of preserving the free status of all 
      derivatives of our free software and<BR>of promoting the sharing and reuse 
      of software generally.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>NO WARRANTY</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, 
      THERE IS NO WARRANTY<BR>FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
      APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; EXCEPT WHEN<BR>OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE 
      COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<BR>PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" 
      WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<BR>OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, 
      BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<BR>MERCHANTABILITY AND 
      FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS<BR>TO THE 
      QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD 
      THE<BR>PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY 
      SERVICING,<BR>REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR 
      AGREED TO IN WRITING<BR>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO 
      MAY MODIFY AND/OR<BR>REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE 
      LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<BR>INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL 
      OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<BR>OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE 
      PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<BR>TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING 
      RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<BR>YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A 
      FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<BR>PROGRAMS), EVEN IF 
      SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<BR>POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
      DAMAGES.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR><BR>How to Apply 
      These Terms to Your New Programs</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>&nbsp; If you develop a new program, and you want it 
      to be of the greatest<BR>possible use to the public, the best way to 
      achieve this is to make it<BR>free software which everyone can 
      redistribute and change under these terms.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the 
      program.&nbsp; It is safest<BR>to attach them to the start of each source 
      file to most effectively<BR>convey the exclusion of warranty; and each 
      file should have at least<BR>the "copyright" line and a pointer to where 
      the full notice is found.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the 
      program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is free software; 
      you can redistribute it and/or modify<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it under the 
      terms of the GNU General Public License as published 
      by<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of 
      the License, or<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (at your option) any later 
      version.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is distributed in 
      the hope that it will be useful,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY 
      WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; See 
      the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU General Public License for more 
      details.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Verdana>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy 
      of the GNU General Public License<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along with this 
      program; if not, write to the Free Software<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA&nbsp; 
      02111-1307&nbsp; USA</FONT></P><FONT face=Verdana>
      <P><BR>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper 
      mail.</P>
      <P>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like 
      this<BR>when it starts in an interactive mode:</P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of 
      author<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO 
      WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is free 
      software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.</P>
      <P>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the 
      appropriate<BR>parts of the General Public License.&nbsp; Of course, the 
      commands you use may<BR>be called something other than `show w' and `show 
      c'; they could even be<BR>mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your 
      program.</P>
      <P>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or 
      your<BR>school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, 
      if<BR>necessary.&nbsp; Here is a sample; alter the names:</P>
      <P>&nbsp; Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the 
      program<BR>&nbsp; `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written 
      by James Hacker.</P>

      <P>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program 
      into<BR>proprietary programs.&nbsp; If your program is a subroutine 
      library, you may<BR>consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary 
      applications with the<BR>library.&nbsp; If this is what you want to do, 
      use the GNU Library General<BR>Public License instead of this 
      License.</P>
